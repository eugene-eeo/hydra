     $ hydra_

    Simple daemon that listens to various services
    and produces output to listening clients. To
    configure it, create the file ~/.hydrarc.json:

    {
      "nmcli": true,
      "pactl": true
    }

    this listens to and outputs sensible events using
    nmcli and pactl. To add support for other services,
    you can add more to the 'procs' key in the root
    config object:

    {
      ...
      "procs": [
        {
          "proc": ["herbstluftwm", "--idle"],
          "matchers": [
            {"name": "hc:focus",      "matcher": "^focus_changed"},
            {"name": "hc:tag_change", "matcher": "^tag_changed"},
          ]
        }
      ]
    }

    upon seeing lines that match ^focus_changed, hydra
    will emit the hc:focus event, and similarly for
    the hc:tag_change event.

    A more involved example for a matcher:

    {
        "&&": [
            {"||": ["^abc", "def$"]},
            "[0-9]",
            "tag"
        ]
    }

    this matcher matches all lines that match "[0-9]", "tag",
    and must match one of "^abc" and "def$". The matchers are
    nestable and very powerful.
